## JEE Performance with JMeter, Prometheus and Grafana. Complete Project from Scratch.

This GitHub project accompanies [this blog post](http://highcohesionloosecoupling.com/index.php/2017/10/08/jee-performance-jmeter-prometheus-grafana-complete-project-scratch/).

It includes:

- couple possible approaches to UUIDs generation
- white-box metrics with Prometheus
- visualization in Grafana
- docker environment containing Wildfly, Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager automatically configured on startup
- metrics:
    - total number of generations (counter), presents absolute values and rate (number of generations per second)
    - total duration of generation (counter), presents absolute values and rate (duration of generations per second)
    - longest duration within last n seconds, n=5 (gauge)
    - queues fill factor (gauge)
- a dashboard with six diagrams 
    - number of generations per second
    - total number of generations
    - duration per second
    - total duration
    - longest duration within n last seconds, n=5
    - queue fill factor
- performance analysis and comparison; data is generated by a "sequential" JMeter test plan, which runs each generator separately
- "random" endpoint - selects randomly a UUID generator; together with a "random" JMeter thread group, it allows live comparison of all generators running at once
- alerts sent to a Slack workspace
