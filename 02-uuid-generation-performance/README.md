## Performance of UUID generation

Work in progress:

- DONE
    - couple possible approaches to UUIDs generation, 
    - white-box metrics with Prometheus
    - visualization in Grafana
    - docker environment containing Wildfly, Prometheus, Grafana automatically configured on startup
    - metrics:
        - total number of generations (counter), allowing to present absolute values and rate (number of generations per second)
        - total duration of generation (counter), allowing to present absolute values and rate (duration of generations per second)
        - longest duration of last n generations, for n=1000 (gauge)
        - queues fill factor (gauge)
    - a single dashboard with six diagrams 
        - number of generations per second
        - total number of generations
        - duration per second
        - total duration
        - longest duration of last n generations
        - queue fill factor
    - performance analysis and comparison; data is generated by a "sequential" JMeter test plan, which runs each generator separately
    - "random" endpoint - selects randomly UUID generator; together with a "random" JMeter test plan allows live comparison of all generators running at once
- PLANNED
    - alert configuration
    - correlation with CPU usage (based on JVM metrics) (?)
    - histograms (?)
    - 95 percentile based on histogram (?)
